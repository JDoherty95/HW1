## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
 A widespread problem is a lack of savings and a lack of understanding about the basics of personal finance. Which Acorns argues had lead to the wealth gap in the US. Acorns wants to help the average investor gain financial freedom through investing advice and pre-packaged ETFs. 
“The types of problems we’re trying to solve [are] that 70 percent of Americans don’t have a $1,000 emergency fund set up, and 66 percent don’t have a dollar saved for retirement. Another 66 percent can’t pass a basic financial literacy test,” - Noah Kerner 
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Acorns currently serves just over eight million customers, with over three billion dollars in assests under management. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
 micro-investing platform that allows users to set up automated investments into a portfolio through Round-Ups: Acorns rounds up a debit or credit card purchase made on a linked card to the nearest dollar and invests the change on behalf of the member.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Acorns is in the micro-investment domain. 
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Major trends in this space are investment banks focused on milennials, who dont have much free cash. Like Robinhood, Acorns wanted to make investing more accesible via the app while having low barriers to signing up. Unlike Robinhood, Acorns helps slow America's spending issue, putting money aside slowly / investing autonomously. 
* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Stash, Robinhood, Betterment, Qapital, Sigfig

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The business impact has already helped new investors put money aside, who wouldnt have already done so. They have successfully reached their target market, and grown in the space of 25-35 year olds making about 50,000 a year, struggling to save with student debt, etc. 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Acorns mainly uses number of users, and assets under management to define their success. They put your money into a self-balencing index fund, the more money managed, the more subscriptions they are selling. 
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Acorns has grown steadily without much changes. However; companies that allow you to pick your own stocks have outperformed, and outgrown, offering the same services. Acorns is a lot like an IRA retirement account, giving you steady returns no matter how much risk the user wants to be exposed to.  

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would adivse the company to come out with new variety of portfolio management. They offer a $1, $2, and $3 a month subscription. This seems cheap, but their customer is only investing their "spare change". If their targer customer uses the platform as advertised, a $1 fee on a $50 investment is a 2% loss. Other brokers (like fidelity, vangaurd) do not charge anything to invest in index funds. 
Acorns should have an even more aggresive fund to invest in, their most aggresive option is the Vangaurd S&P 500 (VOO) which is widespread across multiple industries. There are more aggresive options out there... (cryptocurrencies).  
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This would bring a wider array of services to the consumer, broadening their target market. They are already an asset management firm, that barely surpasses inflation rates. If they want to manage more money they should allow users the ability to pay more, allowing more customization to their risk exposure. 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Sticking with the same theme Acorns already uses. Some technologies this service would use is AI investing. The company already uses AI to adjust which stocks are included in their index depending on the market. A technology like 
Recognia allows you to quickly determine the current technical outlook of a security over short, intermediate, and long-term timeframes based on Recognia's process for analyzing technical events and patterns. This would give users a lot more flexibility. 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
If Acorns planned on charging more, their technology would have to have a lot more facets. Right now, their technology only has three avenues. Low risk, medium risk high risk. An AI set up with Recognia would give users access to higher risk portfolios, would allow portfolios to trade on information based on an automated sum of scores. If the
sum of the events is positive, the view is Strong (bullish). If the sum is zero then the view is
Neutral. If the sum is negative, the view is Weak (bearish).
